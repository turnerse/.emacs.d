This file contains my (Steve Turner's) custom elisp code for Centaur emacs.

This is a literate org file, that gets processed by org-babel-load-file

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (princ (concat (format "Emacs version: %s\n" (emacs-version))
                 (format "org version: %s\n" (org-version))))
#+END_SRC    

Add some more keybindings for org-roam functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (use-package org-roam
    :bind (:map org-roam-mode-map
           (("C-c n d" . org-roam-date)
            ("C-c n j" . org-roam-jump-to-index)
            ("C-c n b" . org-roam-switch-to-buffer)
            ("C-c n t" . org-roam-dailies-today)
            ("C-c n y" . org-roam-dailies-yesterday)
            ("C-c n w" . org-roam-dailies-tomorrow)
            ("C-c n d" . org-roam-dailies-date)
            ("C-c n r" . org-roam-unlinked-references)
            ("C-c n c" . org-roam-capture)
            )))
#+END_SRC    

There are a great many keybindings that are actively hostile, in that they are
bound to useless or obsolete functions that are really easy to trigger
accidentally.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(unbind-key "C-z") ;; suspend-frame
#+END_SRC    

Every Emacs window should, by default occupy all the screen space it can.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(fullscreen . maximized))
#+END_SRC    

I find it useful to have a slightly more apparent indicator of which buffer is
active at the moment.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(use-package dimmer
  :custom (dimmer-fraction 0.6)
  :config (dimmer-mode))

(dimmer-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
